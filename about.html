							<p>In order to produce information Technology Professionals, I.T education requires a high quality competence and infrastructure.
							Today, new packages, newer versions of current software and new technological tools are being adopted by the trade and
							industry periodically. The education therefore, must catch up with these developments well in time so that I.T students do not
							face the problem of obsolescence.Computer & Skill Development Center feels the underlying concepts of new technology and
							tools along with reasonable skills be delivered to the students before they go out in the Industry.</p>
							<p>Thus in a very fast changing technical scenario, concept and practical based education becomes quite important as against toolbased education. Technological changes also demand that institutions must consider the market scenario, and adjust the content and delivery of education matching the expectations of the business houses.</p>
